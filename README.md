# exchange

Exchange is an initiative that seeks to create an Ember knowledge exchange channel across organizations, allowing teams/individuals to spend quality time
at other organizations that use Ember.

This allows for,

1. Teams/individuals to see how Ember is being used across organizations and gain new perspectives/understanding of the possibilities and use cases.
2. Collaboration on common issues.
3. Guest presentations at other organizations.

We will be working on establishing the finer details over the next few weeks but would love your feedback.
